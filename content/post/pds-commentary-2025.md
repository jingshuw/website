We have posted a short commentary on Arxiv that examines the behavior of the **PDS** evaluation metric used in the Virtual Cell Challenge:

👉 [arXiv:2511.16954](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16954)

The note discusses why early improvements in PDS can be unexpectedly difficult to achieve, and how scaling can lead to significant gains by making the usual ℓ₁/ℓ₂-based PDS behave more like a cosine-similarity–based score, which is often more discriminative.

We hope this analysis may be helpful for researchers who are studying the metric or developing methods designed to perform well under PDS.
