A new preprint on Arxiv, *Validity and Power of Heavy-Tailed Combination Tests under Asymptotic Dependence*, develops a unified theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of heavy-tailed p-value combination methods under broad dependence structures:

👉 [arXiv:2508.05818](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05818)

Using multivariate regularly varying copulas to characterize joint lower-tail behavior, the paper shows:

- Heavy-tailed combination tests remain asymptotically valid when p-values have multivariate regularly varying copulas the transformation distribution has tail index \( \gamma \le 1 \).  
- The choice \( \gamma = 1 \) maximizes power while preserving validity.  
- Bonferroni emerges as the limiting \( \gamma \to 0 \) case and becomes overly conservative under asymptotic dependence.  
- Heavy-tailed tests with \( \gamma = 1 \) (e.g., truncated Cauchy or Pareto combinations) achieve increasing asymptotic power gains as lower-tail dependence strengthens.

The framework provides theoretical support for using heavy-tailed combination tests to enhance power while controlling false positives under complex dependence.
