Our paper, *Causal mediation analysis for time-varying heritable risk factors with Mendelian Randomization*, has been published in **Nature Communications**:

👉 [Nature Communications doi: 10.1038/s41467-025-61648-7](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61648-7)  
👉 [Original preprint: bioRxiv 2024.02.10.579129](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.02.10.579129)

The paper introduces **FLOW-MR**, a computational framework for estimating causal structural equations for *temporally ordered* traits using only **GWAS summary statistics**. FLOW-MR enables decomposition of total genetic effects into:

- direct effects  
- indirect mediation effects  
- pathway-specific causal contributions  

Key methodological innovations include:

- handling correlated longitudinal risk factors with limited GWAS sample sizes,  
- improved stability and efficiency under strong polygenicity and weak instruments through a spike-and-slab prior, and  
- robust inference even in noisy settings.

Using FLOW-MR, we identify a **childhood-specific protective effect of BMI on breast cancer**, and analyze the evolving causal impacts of BMI, systolic blood pressure, and cholesterol on stroke risk over the life course.
