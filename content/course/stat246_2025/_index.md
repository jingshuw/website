## Description

In many applications of statistics, a large proportion of the questions of interest are about causality rather than questions of description or association. Does the shift to remote work cause employees to be more or less productive? How does a new tax policy affect the economic activity? Does regular exercise cause improvements in mental health, or is it that people with better mental health are more likely to exercise? In this class, we will introduce some basic concepts and methods in causal inference and focus on computation, applications and case studies related to causal inference. For causal inference methodology, the course plans to cover the potential outcome framework, randomize experiments, observational studies, sensitivity analysis and instrumental variables. For examples and case studies, we will include the California alphabet lottery, the evaluation of job training programs, clinical trials, educational experiments and many more.
