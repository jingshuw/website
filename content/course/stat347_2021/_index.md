## Description

This applied statistics course is a successor of STAT 34300 Applied Linear Statistical Methods and covers the foundations of `generalized linear models (GLM)`. We aim to cover the following topics:

* **GLM model estimation, computation and inference**
* **Specific GLM models for binary, multinomial and count data**
* **Linear and generalized linear mixed effect models**
* **Bayesian approach of GLM**
* **Survival analysis**


This course will make a balance between practical real data analysis with examples and a deeper understanding of the models with mathematical derivations.

## Textbook

- [**Extending the Linear Model with R (second edition)**](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/ELM/) by *Julian J. Faraway* (suggested)

## Grading

* **Homework assignments: 20&#37**
* **Midterm: 35&#37**
* **Final exam: 40&#37**
