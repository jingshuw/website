## Description

This applied statistics course is a successor of STAT 34300 Applied Linear Statistical Methods and covers the foundations of `generalized linear models (GLM)`. We aim to cover the following topics:

- [X] **GLM model estimation, computation and inference**
- [X] **Specific GLM models for binary, multinomial and count data**
- [ ] **Linear and generalized linear mixed effect models**


This course will make a balance between practical real data analysis with examples and a deeper understanding of the models with mathematical derivations.

## Textbook

- [**Foundations of Linear and Generalized Linear Models**](http://users.stat.ufl.edu/~aa/glm/glm.html) by *Alan Agresti* (required) 
- [**Extending the Linear Model with R (second edition)**](https://julianfaraway.github.io/faraway/ELM/) by *Julian J. Faraway* (suggested)
