## Description

In this course, we will have a brief introduction of both the potential outcome framework and the causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) for causal inference. We will discuss topics including confounding, instrumental variables (IV) and mediation analysis, with the applications of causal inference in genetics and epidemiological research.

We will follow the following book for the first 5 weeks:
- - [**Causal  Inference, What If**](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/miguel-hernan/causal-inference-book/) by *Hernán MA, Robins JM*
