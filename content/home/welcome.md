### *Statistical Genetics · Computational Biology · General Statistical Methodology*

We develop statistical methods and machine learning tools for modern biotechnologies and genetic data. Much of our work is motivated by problems in single-cell genomics and complex traits.

Current research directions include:

- Single-cell multi-omics and related high-dimensional data integration  
- Mendelian randomization and causal inference for risk factors  
- Large-scale inference and multiple testing, including p-value combination methods  
- Factor models and other latent-structure methods with applications in statistical genetics
