Our research focuses on developing statistical methods and machine learning tools for cutting-edge biotechnologies and genetic problems. Current projects include single-cell multi-omics, Mendelian randomization, and methodology for large-scale inference. We also work on multiple p-value combination methods to improve replicability and power, causal inference, and factor models, with applications in statistical genetics.
