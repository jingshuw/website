We develop statistical methods and machine learning tools for modern biotechnologies and genetic data. Much of our work is motivated by problems in single-cell genomics and complex traits.

Current research directions include:

- 🧬 Single-cell multi-omics  
- 🎯 Mendelian randomization and causal inference for heritable risk factors  
- 📊 Large-scale inference and multiple testing, including p-value combination methods  
- 🧠 Latent-structure and factor models
