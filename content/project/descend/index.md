summary: An R package to estimate the underlying true gene expression distributions for each gene and a given cell group from noisy scRNA-seq observed UMI counts. DESCEND can also find genes whose dispersion (variance, Gini coefficient) change between cell groups. [Paper](https://jingshuw.org/publication/wang-2018-aa/)
